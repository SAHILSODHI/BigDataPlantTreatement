We will analyse the dataset provided by the city of Montreal that contains 
the list of trees treated against the emerald ash borer 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_ash_borer). The dataset is 
described at 
http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/dataset/frenes-publics-proteges-injection-agrile-du-frene 
(use Google translate to translate from French to English). 

We will use the 2015 and 2016 data sets available in directory `data`.
